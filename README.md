# To Do Application

With zero knowledge about Flutter, I challenged myself to study and finish this test within 7 days. Finally, I did it.

This is a basic application to create a task and handle its statuses. Users can create new tasks and change statuses.

## Installation

Follow the [Flutter Installation Doc](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) to install set-up environment.

### Libraries

- [flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) to manage states.
